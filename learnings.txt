*Really think about HTML Structure - 
- I Put Flex (mobile = Col / Tablet+ = Row) on the Parent (page-header-container) of the  1. Logo  2. mainNav  3. Lg Btn 
- In Mobile M/Q - Pos'd Burger Icon Relative to <pageHeader> & In Tablet+ - I hid it (Disp: none)

      <header class="page-header">

        <div class="page-header-container">

          <div class="logo">
            <div class="company-logo">
              <h1>PHOTOSNAP</h1>
              <a href="#">
                <img src="./logo-black.png" alt="company logo" />
              </a>
            </div>
          </div>

          <nav class="main-nav">
            <div class="main-nav__links inner-container">
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <a class="link-black" href="#">Stories</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a class="link-black" href="#">Features</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <a class="link-black" href="#">Pricing</a>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </nav>

          <div class="btn-mobile-nav-large">
            <button>
              <a href="index.html" class="link-white">Get an invite</a>
            </button>
          </div>

        </div>  
      <!-- end page-header-container -->

           <!-- burger menu & close btn -->
            <button class="btn-mobile-nav btn-mobile-open">
              <a class="mobile-icon" href="#">
                <!-- <svg> via CSS -->
              </a>
            </button>
      </header>

*"The Features" on "pricing PG" - has a diff L/out from Mob to Tabl. 
- on Tabl. I could just put GTCs * 4 on Parent DIV - BUT in Mob. View the 1st Child of the 4 Cols (= the Heading) - had to sit ABOVE the rest of the Childs (which sit in a Row of 3 under it) - I couldnt use F/Bx in Mob & switch to Grid in Tabl. - bc I needed to have the SAME MarkUP - so in Mob. I let the Heading sit ABove the 3 Childs (just w/ Normal Flow) & used Dsiplay: Inline-block on the 3 Childs (so they sat in a Row Under the Heading)

*bc <main-nav> & <lg-btn> were in <PGHeader-container> - which was Inside <PGHeader> - I needed <PGHeader> to be 72px (H) (w/ Overflow: Visible) & <PGHeader-container> to be 325 (H) - ELSE the rest of the PG Content would get pushed Down the PG

*When a DIV with x-amount of Child El's wont Align-center pefectly bc of Line-height on the Top EL' = Added margin-bottom (that matches the VAL of the L/H at top of Top El') to BtM El

*I thought the Hero Img DIV was supposed to Scale Width-wise as PG gets Wider (& that some sort of Object-fit trick to make the Img stay the Same height But the Img just reveal more of its (W) as PG gets Wider) - BUT the IMG ISNT SUPPOSED TO SCALE (it is supposed to stay fixed Size & Only the Hero Text DIV Scales Width-wise (Hero section is always 650px in Tablet+)) - so I made GTCs: 1fr 273px & Hero-section: H = 650px (*I init. had .hero-section GTCs = 65% 35% ) - also removed the <source> (W = 100%) attri (so no W OR H attri)

*Dont set Padding-top/btm for TEXT DIVs that are Vert. Aligned (via F/Bx) w/ an IMG DIV -
 eg. Hero-section__text DIV - just check the Height of that same DIV in Figma Design & match it in CSS (NOT but Explicitly Setting (H) - but w/ using the Same Font-size & Flex-Gaps) & use align/justify-items/content: center instead
 - it was best to use Padding-top/btm on Hero__text in Mobile View bc the Hero Section will only be 1 Col (so dont need to align it (v) in relation to the IMAGE DIV) & also its good to use padding-top/btm bc you DONT SPECIFY a HEIGHT (usually) in Resp. Design

*Flex - justify-items - doesnt like max-width (use flex-basis)
*needed   overflow: hidden - on Container so page header would go 100% (W) 

*needed to get the Footer C/right DIV to be the same Height (so could use justify-content: spac between) as the NAV DIV in Footer (Nav DIVs Height wasnt set Explicitly) - so I used Ch. Dv/T's to see Nav DIV (H) & used that VAL to set a min-height on C/Right DIV 

*Need Z-Index on BOTH States eg. '.main-nav' AND '.mobile-nav-open main-nav'


*Couldnt get Link txt & Link Arrow SVG to align (V) - w/ F/Bx - so just use F/Bx for space between & translateY on Arrow (also removed Line/H from <a>)

*Responsive Img switching wasn't working w/ (& Dev/T's > Properties > currentSrc - wasnt Changing) :
 <!-- <img
            srcset="
              ./assets/home/mobile/create-and-share.jpg  375w,
              ./assets/home/tablet/create-and-share.jpg  273w,
              ./assets/home/desktop/create-and-share.jpg 830w
            "
            sizes="(min-width: 10px) 100vw, (min-width: 767px) 57vw, (min-width: 1439px) 33vw, 375w"
            src="./assets//home/mobile/create-and-share.jpg"
          /> -->

- also = tips from msg boards = ensure device px ratio = 1 in Chr/Dev T's  
- 1 of the probs was the extra wht/spc vscode was adding between the filename & the 375w
- I got it to work w/ Jonas' Imgs & Code        

***** I used instead - <picture> ...<source> & it was Changing from the mobile to tablet BUT NOT to the D/Top Img = I had to change the M/Q - so that the Tablet Img had BOTH min-w & max-w M/Qs - else this img would still render instead of the D/Top Img kicking in at min-w 1439:

 <source
              media="(min-width: 767px) and (max-width: 1438px)"

- <img srcset - Browser Decides due to what you Stipulate
- <picture ...<source> = YOU FORCE Browser to choose your desired img        

- can also Add Width as a % in HTML width attr 

- Full <picture> Code - fro Resp. Img switching (i was trying to match the same code as "srcset" TNQ - BUT you dont need to specify the (W)) - also for some imgs there were only Mobile & D/Top vers - so only needed a "min-width" from 767 for D/Top img

          <picture>
            <source
              media="(min-width: 767px) and (max-width: 1438px)"
              srcset="./assets/home/tablet/create-and-share.jpg"
            />

            <source
              media="(min-width: 1439px)"
              srcset="./assets/home/desktop/create-and-share.jpg"
            />

            <img
              src="./assets/home/mobile/create-and-share.jpg"
              alt="Hero"
            />
          </picture>
        </div>

*When set html font-size - to eg. 62.5% (= 10) - ANY REM you set on an El = Mult. by that (they dont compound)

*Gap between imgs and next div > img {display: block}
*"grey" Txt = eg. opac 0.8

*MOBILE NAV 
*.main-nav = initially = Hidden
- on CLK Need to add "main-nav-open" - TO PARENT of Nav BTN - so can Target .main-nav - when "main-nav-open" has been added to its Parent - eg:
.main-nav-open ~ .main-nav {...css}
//...NEED "~"  - else Selector wont work
// BUT WHEN REFACTORED I DIDNT NEED THE "~" - ".main-nav-open .main-nav" was sufficient

*Switching Mobile Icon:
- these Classes contain SVGs "=" & "X" (Burger Icons)
   In these classes the SVGs are BG-IMGs
  mobileNavBtn.classList.toggle('btn-mobile-open');
  mobileNavBtn.classList.toggle('btn-mobile-close');

- bc the "=" & "X" SVG Icons where Diff H & W to ea. Other - I set their Parent BTN to the W of the Widest of them & same w/ the H - & used BG-Pos: center center

*to get the <picture> to Object-fit - needed the styles in (from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47888165/make-image-in-picture-element-fit-its-container):
 @media screen and (min-width: 35em)
