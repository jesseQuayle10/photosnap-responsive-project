//////////////////// FIX COLOR BAR HEIGHTS /////////
*FIX - color-bars - should only be as High as the Text in Hero sections

////////// STORIES PG /////////////
*Fix Gap between Stories PG Hero & the next section (only happens in CHr- NOT in F/Fx - )

////////// FEATURES PG BETA IMG /////////////

////////// FEATURES PG/PRICING PG BETA SECTION  /////////////
*Fix arrow-link alignment w/ h2 (V) - I think its fixed in Tblet - need to fix it in other M/Qs

*maybe write M/Q to change Hero Img (to D/Top Img) from when Mobile Img starts to look bad until Tablet M/Q

*Toggle (H) of page-header-container so that it is as Tall when Mob Nav is Closed??
////////////////////////////////////////////
*Refactor so all relevant padding/margin VALs are stored in VARs & make them more reusable by using keyword "space-v/w" - instead of "padding/margin"

*Refactor so all EL's w/ eg. same Font sz, ltr-spc & L/H are put into a Class??

*Remove "height" Props from El's (so fully responsive) - EXCEPT From PGHeader bc need it for main-nav to render properly??

*add an animation on main-nav O/Lay - (I tried transition options - been thru the wringer w/ it - SO ONLY TRY ANIMATION CSS)

*What to do about the BG CLR of the DIVs on Dvc's that are wider than 1440

*Do i need to remove .main-nav-open Class via JS RESIZE Evt (bc Overlay stays when rsize to Tablet+)??
